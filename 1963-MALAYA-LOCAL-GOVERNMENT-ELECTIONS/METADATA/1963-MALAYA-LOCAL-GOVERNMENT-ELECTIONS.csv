Disclaimers,"Candidate spellings follow EC spelling standards. There are gaps for candidate age and sex category.  No data available for the component parties for the Socialist Front. In the case of two-member wards, a ballot paper may be used to record two votes. In the case of three-member wards, a ballot paper may be used to record three votes. No Total Ballot Issued values for multi-member wards as no information on unique ballot count was provided. No Information on the type of electoral roll used for the 1963 Malayan Local Government Elections. Turnout level values reflect EC's reporting. The file of Election Details is a combination of EC reported information, The Straits Times and other sources. Voting Electorate refers to electorate size of contested wards. The areas of ten local councils of Trengganu (that were used for 1962 local elections) were deemed too big for effectiveness and efficiency of local government administration. Out of 10 local councils, seven were re-established (Kuala Trengganu Utara, Kuala Trengganu Barat, Kuala Trengganu Selatan, Paka, Kemaman, Besut). Candidate of Darat Makbar Timor Ward (Kuantan) association with MIC is guessed. The name of MCA Candidate of Temiang Atas Ward (Seremban) is not very clear. Candidates of Rim Ward (Jasin) association with MIC is guessed. The UDP candidate of Ujong Pasir Ward (Municipality of Town and Fort of Malacca) was former UMNO member who contested as protest of UMNO's fielding of J.L. D'Cruz (who is UMNO associate member).
