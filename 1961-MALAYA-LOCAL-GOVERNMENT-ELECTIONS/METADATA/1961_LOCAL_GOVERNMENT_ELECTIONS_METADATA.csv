Disclaimers,"Candidate spellings follow EC spelling standards. There are gaps for candidate age and sex category. There remains an incomplete association of parties with the Alliance Coalition. No data available for the component parties for the Socialist Front. Lau Oh Toh (Paul Street Ward, Seremban) is a PPP member but opted to contest as an independent. Some councils elect more than one councillor. In the case of two-member wards, a ballot paper may be used to record two votes. In the case of three-member wards, a ballot paper may be used to record three votes. No Information on the type of electoral roll used for the 1961 Malayan Local Government Elections. There is a dispute in distribution of candidates losing deposit in Trengganu where EC claims PMIP had 9 candidates lost deposit and Socialist Front had 5 candidates lost deposit. However, According to The Straits Times, 5 July 1961, Page 7, PMIP had 8 candidate lost deposit (5 in Besut, 2 in Kuala Trengganu and 1 in Kemaman). Lost Deposit tags for Besut wards of Kampong Raja Tengah, Seberang Pantai Barat and Bandar Jerteh Utara are guessed.Lost Deposit for PMIP for Kampong Besut (Local Authority Area of Kemaman) is guessed. Turnout level values reflect EC's reporting. There are discrepancy from EC's reporting on voter turnout for Losong, Pasir Panjang, Paya Bunga, Pejabat Bandaran and Pulau Kambing Wards (Local Authority Area of Kuala Terengganu). There is discrepancy from EC's reporting on voter turnout for Sungei Bakap Selatan Ward.
